    "1. *One tailed t-test* - In a packing plant, a machine packs cartons with jars. It is supposed that a new machine will pack faster on the average than the machine currently used. To test that hypothesis, the times it takes each machine to pack ten cartons are recorded. The results, in seconds, are shown in the tables in the file `files_for_lab/ttest_machine.xlsx.`.\n",
    "   Assume that there is sufficient evidence to conduct the t test, does the data provide sufficient evidence to show if one machine is better than the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Matched Pairs Test* - In this challenge we will compare dependent samples of data describing our Pokemon (file `files_for_lab/pokemon.csv`). Our goal is to see whether there is a significant difference between each Pokemon's defense and attack scores. Our hypothesis is that the defense and attack scores are equal. Compare the two columns to see if there is a statistically significant difference between them and comment your result.\n",

We want to understand whether there are significant differences among various types of pokemons' Total value, i.e. Grass vs Poison vs Fire vs Dragon... There are many types of pokemons which makes it a perfect use case for ANOVA. (file `files_for_lab/pokemon.csv`)\n",
